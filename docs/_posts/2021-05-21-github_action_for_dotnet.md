## Motivation
In this post, I would like to share knowledge about building software workflows for .net library. Few months ago I decided to publicly release my **dotnet library [Middlink](https://github.com/Measureit/Middlink)** by using Github actions. So far my all private projects was hosted in GitLab and it's time to use something else.

I always try touch few different solutions to grab some experience and grow as a software developer. This approach help changing the perspective during solving problems and increases decision-making.

## 1. Introduction

GitHub actions are a **free mechanism** to create software automation by using YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) scripts. Itâ€™s possible to build complex automated processes from many workflows scripts containing many jobs containing many steps. This combination definitely helps to orchestrate tasks and it makes the whole process becomes more understandable. 

We can use GitHub actions to handle such a task like:
  
  - **build source code**
  - **run tests**
  - **evaluate code quality**
  - **build documentation**
  - **publish artifacts**
  - **release notification**

 ... and much more.

There are two possibilities to start using Github actions in new repository.

- **From the template**
  - go to web page https://github.com
  - create/navigate to destination repository
  - navigate to **Actions tab**
  - choose workflow template
  - commit workflow script into destination branch

<span class="caption text-muted">Github actions tab</span>

- **From the scratch**
  - clone repository
  - create directory **.github\workflows** in project root
  - create ``<workflow_name>.YAML`` file with workflow definition in directory .github\workflow

<div id='id-script-structure'/>

## 2. Script structure


Let's get started by creating simple workflow script and describing in details what this **magic lines** means.

First line should contains **``name``** of workflow and it is optional. I strongly recommend include this line because it'll increas script readability (Github will attach this name into pipeline visualization).

```bash
1. name: <workflow_name>
```

Next important part is **``on``** keyword and it define workflow triggers. There are definitions of rules for triggering execution in this section. 
Triggers can be activate by:
- GitHub events
- scheduled time
- outside events

```bash
on:
  push:
    tags:
    - "v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+"
```

For more information, see ["Events that trigger workflows".](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows)



The vital section of scipt is **``jobs``** where we specify work to do. Each job must include a unique job ID. Jobs run in parallel by default.

Use keyword **``jobs.<job_id>.needs``** to change default behavior and run jobs sequentially.
{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      working-directory: ./src

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build -c Release
      working-directory: {% raw %} ${{env.working-directory}} {% endraw %} 
```

Job definition starts by set **``runs-on``** where runner is define. 
We can use Github hosted runner:
- Windows
- Ubuntu Linux
- macOS

... or create our own VM for running jobs.

A job contains list of sequential steps. Main **``steps``** responsibility is configure runner and execute commands. 

Github actions have mechanism named **actions** to define combination of predefined commands which arm runtime with necessary tools and tasks. To apply predefined runtime configuration we have to use **``use``** keyword. 

Our sample step uses the **actions/checkout@v2** provided by GitHub community and it handle checkout commit which triggered workflow. 

There is possibility to parameterized actions mechanism by using keyword **``with``**. You can create your own actions, or use and customize actions shared by the GitHub community. [Take a look on shared actions.](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)

## 3. Workflows directory

Now we know basics how Github actions works. Let's try build useful workflows for .net library.

I would like to split my automation process for 3 main blocks. Blocks definition will be put into separate files in **.github\workflows** directory.

*   **continouse-integration.yaml**
    > Trigger: push or pull request on master or develop
    >
    > Motivation: build and test source code
*   **code-analysis.yaml**
    > Trigger: push or pull request on master
    >
    > Trigger: cron job on master
    >
    > Motivation: generate code quality metrics
*   **publish.yaml**
    > Trigger: push with tag containing version number
    >
    > Motivation: publish nuget packages


<div id='id-continouse-integration-workflow'/>

## 4. Continouse integration workflow

Main aim of this script is build and test our source code. This workflow is triggered by **push** or **pull request** on branches develop or master. I would like to avoid waisting resources so I decided use keyword **``paths-ignore``** to exclude workflow execution for ``**.md`` files changes. 

Workflow use latest ubuntu runner. There is possibility to define some workfow constants in **``env``** section. I used it to set source code location. 


The key part of build job are 3 steps definition.
- **Checkout** -  use predefined action **actions/checkout@v2** to checkout triggered git commit

- **Build** - execute dotnet build command in working directory
{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

- **Test** - execute dotnet test command in working directory. There is **--no-build** flag to avoid redundant build.
{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
dotnet test -c Release --no-build
```

{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
      - master
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
      - master
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      working-directory: ./src

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build -c Release
      working-directory: {% raw %} ${{env.working-directory}} {% endraw %}

    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test -c Release --no-build
      working-directory: {% raw %} ${{env.working-directory}} {% endraw %}
```

<div id='id-code-analisis-workflow'/>

## 4. Code analisis workflow

Aim of this script is apply quality gate for C# projects. This workflow is triggered by **push**, **pull request** or **scheduled** as a cron job.

Workflow use latest ubuntu runner and a lot of predefined actions containing [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) tool. Important part is configure project language to execute right analyze.

{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 10 * * 6'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'csharp' ]
        # CodeQL supports [ 'cpp', 'csharp', 'go', 'java', 'javascript', 'python' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
      with:
        languages: {% raw %} ${{ matrix.language }} {% endraw %}
        queries: security-and-quality

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v1

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1

```

After first execution we can observe analyze results in Github repository webpage and start improve code quality.

<span class="caption text-muted">Alerts after code analisis</span>


<div id='id-publish-workflow'/>

## 5. Publish workflow

Last workflow responsibility is publish .net library on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/). To avoid accidental publishing, the workflow is triggered to push a tag that match the version pattern (e.g. **v.1.4.1**).

Workflow use latest ubuntu runner.

Let's go through steps definition.
- **Checkout** - use predefined action **actions/checkout@v2** to checkout triggered git commit

- **Setup dotnet** - use predefined action **actions/setup-dotnet@v1** to setup dotnet environment **``with``** version ``5.0.100-rc.1.20452.10``

- **Set VERSION variable from tag** - read version number from git tag and set it as variable

- **Build** - execute dotnet publish command with version number read from git tag

{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release /p:Version=${VERSION}
```

To generate nuget packages (****.nupkg**) dotnet project file should looks like this.

{% include code-header.html %}
```csharp
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
    <PackageId>Middlink.Core</PackageId>
    <Version>1.1.3.2</Version>
    <Authors>JarosÅ‚aw Kurdzieko</Authors>
    <Owners>Measureit</Owners>
    <ProjectUrl>http://measureit.pl</ProjectUrl>
    <Copyright>Copyright (c) Measureit</Copyright>
    <Product>Middlink</Product>
    <Description>Middlewares interface library.</Description>
    <PackageTags>Middlink</PackageTags>
    <LangVersion>9.0</LangVersion>
    <PackageLicenseExpression>MIT</PackageLicenseExpression>
    <RepositoryType>Git</RepositoryType>
    <PackageReleaseNotes>Release notes:</PackageReleaseNotes>
    <RepositoryUrl>https://github.com/Measureit/Middlink</RepositoryUrl>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

- **Test** - execute dotnet test command with version number read from git tag. There is **--no-build** flag to avoid redundant build.

{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
dotnet test -c Release /p:Version=${VERSION} --no-build
```

- **Push nuget** - push packages into NuGet instance
  > secrets.NUGET_DEPLOY_KEY and secrets.NUGET_URL are store in **[Encrypted secrets
](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)**

- **Upload Artifact** - upload artifacts


{% include code-header.html %}
```bash
name: Release Middlink

on:
  push:
    tags:
    - "v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+"

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      working-directory: ./src
      artifact-directory: ./bin
      
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '5.0.100-rc.1.20452.10'
        
    - name: Set VERSION variable from tag
      run: echo "VERSION=${GITHUB_REF/refs\/tags\/v/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet publish -c Release /p:Version=${VERSION}
      working-directory: {% raw %} ${{env.working-directory}} {% endraw %}
      
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test -c Release /p:Version=${VERSION} --no-build
      working-directory: {% raw %}${{env.working-directory}}  {% endraw %}
      
    - name: Push nuget
      run: dotnet nuget push **/*.nupkg
        --api-key {% raw %} ${{ secrets.NUGET_DEPLOY_KEY }} {% endraw %}
        --source  {% raw %} ${{ secrets.NUGET_URL }} {% endraw %}
        --no-symbols true

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: Middlink
        path: {% raw %} ${{ env.artifact-directory }}/AnyCPU/Release {% endraw %}
      name: Upload Artifact

```

## 6. Summary

Github actions are powerful tool to automate software process. There is a lot of possibilities to improve you workflow by using exisitng templates and shared GitHub community actions.  I strongly recommend drill down this solution and rate it yourself.
