## Motivation
In this post, I would like to share knowledge about building software workflows for .net library. Few months ago I decided to publicly release my **dotnet library [Middlink](https://github.com/Measureit/Middlink)** by using GitHub actions. So far my all private projects was hosted in GitLab and it's time to use something else.

I always try touch few different solutions to grab some experience and grow as a software developer. This approach help changing the perspective during solving problems and increases decision-making.
